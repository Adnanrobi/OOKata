# Contributors Guide
Please read this before you post a new problem or edit and existing problem or closing a problem.

## Adding a new problem
* Please maintain the template that appears when creating a problem.
* The problem should be language agnostic, that means the solution should not require any specific programming language. However, if a sample code is required, it can be given in one or multiple languages. In that case please mention in which language the code is written.
* Copying problems from other sources is very much acceptable. Consider mentioning the source in that case.
* The formatting can be done using markdown. Learn markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Post a problem [here](https://github.com/iut-cse/oo-problem-catalog/issues/new?template=problem.md).
* Check "Tips to write a good problem" below.

## Editing an existing problem
If you find a problem that needs improvement, you are welcome to edit it yourself. Follow the guidelines mentioned in "Adding a new problem".

## Closing a problem
Please do not delete any problem in any circumstances. Rather close it to hide from usual search result when necessary. There can be many reasons to close a problem, including the followings:
* Another problem is an almost duplicate of this problem. Note that similar problems can (and should) co-exist. But if the scenario and problem statement both are almost the same, then close a problem. This is possible when a problem is copied from the same source.
* The problem is irrelevant. If it is not an OOP problem, it should be closed.

## Tips to write a good problem
These are only tips, not hard and fast rules. You can always ignore these tips to make the problem better.
* Write with correct grammar and spelling.
* Prefer using simple and well-known vocabulary.
* Use Grammarly to check your spelling, grammar and language.
* Do not start your problem with "assume", "suppose", "imagine" or similar words. Rather write a story and get the reader into the problem.
* Alternate between gender-specific terms in alternative paragraphs instead of writing "he/she", "her/his" etc every time. Of course, you cannot do that when you are referring to a character in your problem.
