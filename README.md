# OO Problem Catalog
This repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/iut-cse/oo-problem-catalog/issues) is used as Object Oriented Problem Catalog.

# How to Use
* Visit the [issues](https://github.com/iut-cse/oo-problem-catalog/issues) to find the existing problems
* Like the problem if you find it interesting and helpful. This will help others to easily identify good problems to solve. Also, dislike the problem if you find it uninteresting and not so good.
* Comment about the problem. Is the description unclear? Do you think it is too easy or too difficult than what is mentioned? Comment about it.
* Discussion about the solution is OK. But do not paste a solution. Give a link to the solution instead.
* Do you have an interesting problem? [Post it](https://github.com/iut-cse/oo-problem-catalog/issues/new).

# Before you post a problem
* Please maintain the template that appears when creating a problem
* The problem should be language agnostic, that means the solution should not require any specific programming language. However, if a sample code is required, it can be given in one or multiple languages. In that case please mention in which language the code is writen.
* The formatting can be done using markdown. Learn markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
